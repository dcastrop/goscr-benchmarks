# Dynamically Updatable Multiparty Session Protocols

This file contains the tool GoScr, as well as the benchmarks used in the paper
"Dynamically Updatable Multiparty Session Protocols". 

The benchmark base cases are under `benchmarks/<n>.<benchmark_name>/base` and
the GoScr versions are under `benchmarks/<n>.<benchmark_name>/goscr`. To
generate the code and compile the benchmarks, please use the scripts in
`benchmarks/scripts`. The directory `nuscr` contains the code for our tool.

## Getting Started

We provide a script `getting_started.sh` that runs a typical GoScr workflow
step-by-step. This takes only a few minutes, and illustrates the behaviour
of the scripts under `benchmarks/scripts`.

## Hands-on Exercise
